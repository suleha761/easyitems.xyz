It’s a dead star that has collapsed on itself and ends up measuring only a few kilometers in diameter. Michell&#039;s simplistic calculations assumed that such a body might have the same density as the sun. Unlike seeds formed from the first population of stars (also known as population iii stars ), direct collapse black hole seeds are formed by a direct, general relativistic instability.</p>
