    <p>When a comet&#039;s orbit brings it close to the sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. 25/09/2019 · comets are invisible except when they are near the sun. When a comet&#039;s orbit brings it close to the sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. The dust and gases form a tail that stretches away from the sun for millions of kilometers. These are seen once and then disappear for millennia.</p>
