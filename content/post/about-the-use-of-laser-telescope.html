    <p>Telescopes make it possible to study distant objects such as planets, stars, and galaxies. 24/10/2015 · most laser pointers shine only as long as you hold down a button. Once the laser is mounted and coaligned with the scope, you just move the scope around till it&#039;s pointing at your target star, and when you look in the eyepiece, there it is. They’re what help us understand the universe. It goes without saying that a power laser can only be used when there is no plane or satellite in the sky, a glare.</p>
