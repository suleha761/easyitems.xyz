    <p>03/03/2021 · during a lunar eclipse, earth comes between the sun and the moon, blocking the sunlight falling on the moon. A partial lunar eclipse happens when only part of earth&#039;s shadow covers the moon. Lunar eclipses occur when the moon is near a node at full moon and solar eclipses take place when it is near a node at new moon. The earth&#039;s umbra starts moving over the moon. The earth&#039;s penumbra starts covering the moon&#039;s surface.</p>
