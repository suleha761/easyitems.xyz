    <p>Galaxies and clusters are the ensembles of stars and other astronomical objects bound together by gravitational forces. Clusters of galaxies are large assemblies of galaxies, hot gas and dark matter bound together by gravity. The milky way belongs to a small cluster known as the local group, but other clusters can contain hundreds or thousands of galaxies. Galaxy clusters are now one of the most important . While they have no sharply defined edges, they generally extend a few tens of .</p>
